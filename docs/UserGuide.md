## Pacebook

At its core, Pacebook helps running coaches like you to manage your runners’ contacts effectively. But it's also much
more than that. It helps you keep track of runners’ data, such as their timings, training sessions, and emergency
contacts. It also allows you to find your athletes easily and monitor their improvements over time. So, whether you are
a private coach or training a professional running club, let Pacebook match your pace.

Pacebook is a **desktop application designed for running coaches to manage runners, training plans, and essential contact information efficiently**. It is optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)**, enabling fast interaction while still providing a simple graphical interface.

Unlike generic contact management tools, Pacebook is tailored specifically for **training environments**, where quick access to structured runner data is critical for planning and execution.

    * **Mac:** [Java installation guide for Mac](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).
    * **Linux:** [Java installation guide for Linux](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationLinux.html).

2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for Pacebook.

4. Open a command terminal and run the application using the following commands:
   ```
   cd [home folder]
   java -jar pacebook.jar
   ```
5. After a few seconds, the application window should appear, as shown below. The app includes sample data to help you get started.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

6. Type a command into the command box and press Enter to run it. For example, typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all athletes.

   * `addathlete n/John Doe a/21 p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com ad/John street, block 123, #01-01 d/01/01/2001` : Adds an athlete named `John Doe` to Pacebook.

   * `deleteathlete 3` : Deletes the 3rd athlete shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all athletes.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

7. See the [Features](#features) section below for the full list of commands and how to use them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are values you need to provide.
  For example, in `addathlete n/NAME`, `NAME` should be replaced with the athlete’s actual name, such as `addathlete n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.
  For example, `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/sprinter` or just `n/John Doe`.

* Items followed by `…` can be used multiple times, including zero times.
  For example, `[t/TAG]…` can be omitted completely, or used as `t/teamA`, `t/teamA t/relay`, and so on.

* Parameters can be entered in any order unless otherwise stated.
  For example, if the command format is `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, then `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` also works.

* Extra words added to commands that do not take parameters, such as `help`, `list`, `exit`, and `clear`, will be ignored.
  For example, `help 123` will still be read as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this guide, be careful when copying commands that span multiple lines, since some spaces around line breaks may be lost when pasting.
</div>

### Viewing help : `help`

Opens the help window.

Format: `help`

Expected output:
* A help window opens with a summary of available commands.

Tip:

* Sorting is applied to the currently displayed athlete list.
* For `pb`, athletes with no recorded timings will appear after athletes with recorded timings.

Warnings:
* `sort` only changes the display order of athletes. It does not modify any athlete data.
* `pb` refers to the athlete’s personal best 2.4km timing based on recorded timing entries.
* If no athletes are currently displayed, the command will have no visible effect.

Expected output:
* A success message confirming the field and order used for sorting.
* The displayed athlete list is reordered accordingly.

Tip:
* Avoid using `clear` if you only want to remove one athlete. Use `deleteathlete` instead.

---

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

Expected output:
* The application closes.

Tip:
* There is no need to save manually before exiting because Pacebook saves automatically after successful changes.

---

### Saving the data

Pacebook saves your data automatically whenever a command changes it, so you do not need to save manually.

Expected output:
* No separate save confirmation may be shown, but your data will be written to the data file after successful commands.

Tip:
* Close the application normally using `exit` to reduce the risk of interrupted file writes.

---

### Editing the data file

Pacebook stores its data as a JSON file at `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users can edit this file directly if needed.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes corrupt the data file, Pacebook may discard unreadable data or fail to load it correctly the next time it runs. It is strongly recommended to back up the file before editing it manually.
Furthermore, certain edits can cause Pacebook to behave in unexpected ways if values are outside the accepted format. Edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

Tip:
* Manual file editing is meant for advanced users only. Most users should use the app commands instead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Pacebook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the application window will open off-screen. The solution is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
