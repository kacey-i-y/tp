Pacebook is a **desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, AB3 can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Quick start

1. Ensure that Java `17` or above is installed on your computer.<br>
   If you do not have Java installed, follow the installation guide for your operating system:
    * **Windows:** [Java installation guide for Windows](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationWindows.html).
    * **Mac:** [Java installation guide for Mac](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).
    * **Linux:** [Java installation guide for Linux](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationLinux.html).

2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for Pacebook.

4. Open a command terminal and run the application using the following commands:
   ```
   cd [home folder]
   java -jar pacebook.jar
   ```
5. After a few seconds, the application window should appear, as shown below. The app includes sample data to help you get started.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

6. Type a command into the command box and press Enter to run it. For example, typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all athletes.

   * `addathlete n/John Doe a/21 p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com ad/John street, block 123, #01-01 d/01/01/2001` : Adds an athlete named `John Doe` to Pacebook.

   * `deleteathlete 3` : Deletes the 3rd athlete shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all athletes.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

7. See the [Features](#features) section below for the full list of commands and how to use them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are values you need to provide.  
  For example, in `addathlete n/NAME`, `NAME` should be replaced with the athlete’s actual name, such as `addathlete n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.  
  For example, `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or just `n/John Doe`.

* Items followed by `…` can be used multiple times, including zero times.  
  For example, `[t/TAG]…` can be omitted completely, or used as `t/friend`, `t/friend t/team`, and so on.

* Parameters can be entered in any order.  
  For example, if the command format is `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, then `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` also works.

* Extra words added to commands that do not take parameters, such as `help`, `list`, `exit`, and `clear`, will be ignored.  
  For example, `help 123` will still be read as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this guide, be careful when copying commands that span multiple lines, since some spaces around line breaks may be lost when pasting.

### Clearing all entries : `clear`

### Exiting the program : `exit`

### Saving the data

Pacebook saves your data automatically whenever a command changes it, so you do not need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

Pacebook stores its data as a JSON file at `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users can edit this file directly if needed.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes corrupt the data file, Pacebook will discard all data and start with an empty data file the next time it runs. Hence, it is recommended to store a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the Pacebook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Pacebook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the application window will open off-screen. The solution is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
